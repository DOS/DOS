# Validators

A blockchain validator is someone who is responsible for verifying transactions on a blockchain. Once transactions are verified, they are added to the distributed ledger. In proof of stake (PoS) systems like [﻿](https://doschain.com/)**DOS Chain**, our validators are given [rewards](http://support.avalabs.org/en/articles/4587396-what-are-validator-staking-rewards) as long as they correctly participate in the network. This mechanism helps secure the network by imposing the need to lock up value in the network in order to participate in the consensus decisions.

Validators will form the backbone of our DOS network. Each validator processing transactions and participating in consensus will enable DOS to become the most secure and safe network in the world.

A Subnet requires validators that secure both the Subnet, and the primary network (X,P, and C chain). It is up to the node operator to ensure the optimal health of the node.

DOS is an incredibly lightweight network, so nodes can run on commodity hardware. Note that as network usage increases, hardware requirements may change.

* CPU: Equivalent of 8 AWS vCPU
* RAM: 16 GB
* Storage: 1 TB
* OS: Ubuntu 20.04 or MacOS >= 12

### Validator Rewards <a href="#o-lx7" id="o-lx7"></a>

When a [Validator](/broken/pages/oqa6hZZA5xDX4VgBY5gZ)﻿ is done validating the transaction it receives a reward for helping to secure the network by validating. A validator only receives a validation reward if it is sufficiently responsive and correct during the time it validates. A validator must maintain at least an 80% uptime to receive rewards.

To be able to validate DOS Chain, the node must have a validator of Avalanche Network.
